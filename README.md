ok im done putting effort in, im either sitting alone or with friends in various areas, im mostly spotted near the mcyt/mha area but i cycle through spots.
i dont bite but, i am very opinionated on fandom topics like shipping and such, like im not a grown ass thing with a job.
im not much of a talker, and am **mostly afk or offtab** , whisper me if you want my attention or to come sit. i also do irish goodbyes don't take it to heart.

i can struggle reading text tones, so tone tags are appreciated but not forced i'll ask when needed, i also occasionally use tone tags because i feel like i come off very blunt, ask me to stop and i will so simple so easy.

dont copy my skins idk why you would, inspo is fine.
